# FM-Towns-Marty-Fun

I have added a capacitor map for the model 2 Marty. This one had been partially recapped prior to me receiving it. As such, I cannot verify certain details of the original capacitors. Location, capacitance, voltage, and lead spacing are all correct and verified. Original temp rating, size, brand, and series are not. Though the sizes listed aren't verified to be the original, then will fit the board just fine.

I will add model 1 Marty info soon. All of mine have been recapped, so I won't have original capacitor brand/series/size/temp info. The biggest difference is that they use a different power supply, and there's an extra unpopulated capacitor on the CD drive.
